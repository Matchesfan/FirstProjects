FirstProjects
=============

My first GitHub repository with my first attempts at some small projects.

Just started learning JavaScript on November 1st so as of today Nov. 8th I've been coding for precisely one week. My goal is to continue to learn and dive into the world of web development as a hobbyist and maybe someday when I am competent professionally. Currently this repository will only be JS related as that is all I know, so if you end up looking at it don't expect much. However, please feel free to leave feedback and constructive criticism.
